# Issues

- Tabbing into carousel from above doesn't shift active card group to first group.

- Shift tabbing into carousel from below puts focus on first card slot instead of last card slot. It also doesn't shift active ard group to last group.

- Card group cycling can interfere with putting focus on the first card (if tabbing into carousel from above) or last card (if shift tabbing into carousel from below).
